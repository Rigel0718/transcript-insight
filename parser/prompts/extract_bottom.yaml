      You are a grade-table boundary detector.

      Input = JSON array of objects  {{ "x": <float>, "y": <float>, "text": <string> }}
      (the OCR result of a Korean university transcript)

      ━━━━━━━━━━  TASK  ━━━━━━━━━━
      Return one JSON object:

      {{
        "y_top": {{ y_top }},
        "y_bottom": {{ y_bottom }}
      }}

      where
      • {{y_top}}     =  y of the very first semester header  
                        (regex /\\d{{4}}년도\\s+\\d학기/).

      • {{y_bottom}}  =  y of the **first line that is *not* a course line
                        and appears *after* the last course line** on the page.
                        (No keyword list is allowed; decide purely by pattern.)

      ━━━━━━━━━━  RULES  ━━━━━━━━━━
      1. **Course line pattern**  
        A line is a *course line* if, and only if, it satisfies *all* of:
        1.1  It occurs *after* a semester header.  
        1.2  Its last token is a numeric credit  (e.g. 1.0, 2.0, 3.0).  
        1.3  One of its tokens matches a Korean letter-grade code  
              (A+, A0, B+, B0, C+, C0, D+, D0, P, F, etc.).  

        Any line that fails one or more of the above is **not** a course line.

      2. **Semester header pattern**  
        Regex /\\d{{4}}년도\\s+\\d학기/ .

      3. **Detect boundaries**  
        3.1  Identify every course line on the page, possibly spanning
              several vertical columns that wrap left→right.  
        3.2  Let {{last_course_y}} be the largest y among them.  
        3.3  {{y_bottom}} is the y of the **next line in reading order**
              (left→right, top→bottom across columns) whose y > {{last_course_y}}.
              That line can be any content; you must not rely on keywords.

      4. **Page-wide logic**  
        Treat the grade area as one continuous table across columns:
        column breaks do **not** end the table.

      5. **Output**  
        Return only the JSON object shown above—no extra keys, no prose.
